# online-Cloud-RESUME

This is my online cloud resume Frontend repository. It contians the source code for the website. The backend repository can be found on my Gitlab account https://gitlab.com/Browndom

My online cloud resume is build with HTML and CSS, hosted on AWS cloud. Visit it here https://www.brownresume.link/

AWS Services such as S3, Cloudfront and Route 53 was used to host my resume website on AWS using the AWS console.

VScode was my text editor.

After deploying the website using the console, I used terraform as my IAC (infrastructure as code) to deploy the website pragmatically.

Also, for static website AWS Amplify can be used to easily host your website with less knowledge of AWS.

The diagram below shows a high level over view of the AWS architecture.

To be able to configure this architecture you will need an AWS account and willingness to spend few $. Also, willingness to fail and learn from it.
